## Introduction
This repository contains an image classification model built using ResNeXt-50 (32x4d) for high-performance training and inference. The model was fine-tuned on a dataset with 100 classes, leveraging techniques like dropout, label smoothing, and adaptive learning rate scheduling to improve generalization. The training pipeline includes data augmentation, efficient batch loading, and a modified prediction generation system to align with expected test formats. The final model achieved 85% validation accuracy and 0.92 submission score.
